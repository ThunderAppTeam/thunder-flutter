  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/resolution-aware-images
  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/asset-from-package
  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:

  assets:
    - .env
    - assets/images/camera/
    - assets/images/icons/
    - assets/images/welcome/
    - assets/images/logos/
    - assets/images/splash/
    - assets/images/app_icon/

  fonts:
    - family: Pretendard
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Pretendard/Pretendard-Thin.ttf
          weight: 100
        - asset: assets/fonts/Pretendard/Pretendard-ExtraLight.ttf
          weight: 200
        - asset: assets/fonts/Pretendard/Pretendard-Light.ttf
          weight: 300
        - asset: assets/fonts/Pretendard/Pretendard-Regular.ttf
          weight: 400
        - asset: assets/fonts/Pretendard/Pretendard-Medium.ttf
          weight: 500
        - asset: assets/fonts/Pretendard/Pretendard-SemiBold.ttf
